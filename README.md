# Arduino Based Voice Controlled Car

## Project Overview
This is a voice controlled car that is made with Arduino. It is a multifunctional car. It can be controlled easily by any android smartphone with an app. It can run like a normal car. It can take video of its surroundings when it is moving. It can detect obstacles that is close to it to avoid collision. User can control the car within a fixed range. User can control it by their own voice commands. The car will follow the voice command and work accordingly. 

## Instruments
A. Hardware:
1. Arduino Mega 2560
2. Bluetooth Device
3. Motor Driver
4. Motor
5. Chassis 
6. Wheel
7. Wires
8. Li-po Battery
9. Sensors
10. Android Smartphone

B. Software:
1. Proetus (ISIS 7 Professional)
2. Arduino 
3. MIT App Inventor

## Features
1. The car can move forward, backward, right, left.
2.	It can fully control by an android smart phone.
3.	It has rotating feature. It can rotate back or front and left or right.
4.	It can take video of its surrounding while moving. 
5.	The car can also be used as an obstacle detector.
6.	It has two-way functions. User can either control it by the manual button of the app or they can control it by their voice. 

## Working Principal
At first, we have set the wheels to the chassis. Then we fit the Adriano with it. Arduino is powered by a Li-Po battery. Then we set the motors. Motors are also connected with the power source. All the motors are connected to the Arduino with some connecting wires. Then we set a sensor in front of the car to detect object. We also set a Bluetooth module to receive signal from the smartphone. 
Then we write the code for Arduino. We design the whole connection in the proteus.
Then we started our work of Android app making in MIT App Inventor. Firstly, we design the model of the app. Then we write the code of the app. 

## Conclusion
Many features are implemented in this project including the Android app. In future, this project will be developed by adding more interesting features in it. The app will also be released in google play store.
