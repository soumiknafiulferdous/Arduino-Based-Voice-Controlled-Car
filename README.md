# Arduino Based Voice Controlled Car

## Overview
This is a voice controlled car that is made with Arduino. It is a multifunctional car. It can be controlled easily by any android smartphone with an app. It can run like a normal car. It can take video of its surroundings when it is moving. It can detect obstacles that is close to it to avoid collision. User can control the car within a fixed range. User can control it by their own voice commands. The car will follow the voice command and work accordingly. Many features are implemented in this project including the Android app.

## Instruments
A. Hardware:
1. Arduino Mega 2560
2. Bluetooth Device
3. Motor Driver
4. Motor
5. Chassis 
6. Wheel
7. Wires
8. Li-po Battery
9. Sensors
10. Android Smartphone

B. Software:
1. Proetus (ISIS 7 Professional)
2. Arduino 

## Working Principal
At first, the wheels are set to the chassis. Then Adriano is fit with it. The Arduino is powered by a Li-Po battery. Then motors are started. Motors are also connected with the power source. All the motors are connected to the Arduino with some connecting wires. Then a sensor is set in front of the car to detect object. Bluetooth module is also attatched to receive signal from the smartphone. 

Then the code for Arduino is written. The whole connection is designed in the proteus.

Then the work of Android app development was started. At first, the model of the app was designed. Then the code of the app was written.

## Features
1. The car can move forward, backward, right, left.
2. It can fully control by an android smart phone.
3. It has rotating feature. It can rotate back or front and left or right.
4. It can take video of its surrounding while moving. 
5. The car can also be used as an obstacle detector.
6. It has two-way functions. Users can either control it by the manual button of the app or they can control it by their voice.
